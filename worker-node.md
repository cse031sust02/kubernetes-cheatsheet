A Worker Node is a vital component in a Kubernetes cluster. It is essentially a machine (virtual or physical) where the actual workload runs. Each worker node contains the necessary services to manage the networking between the containers, communicate with the master node, and assign resources to the scheduled containers.

### Components of a Worker Node:

#### Kubelet:
The kubelet is an agent that runs on each worker node in the cluster and ensures that containers are running in a pod.
It takes the pod specifications provided by the master node (in the form of a PodSpec) and ensures that the described containers are running and healthy.

#### Docker:
Docker is a container runtime that runs containers on the worker node.
It downloads images, manages containers, and facilitates the container lifecycle.

#### Kube-Proxy:
Kube-Proxy maintains network rules on nodes. These network rules allow network communication to your pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.
It handles incoming and outgoing traffic, directing it to the appropriate container.
